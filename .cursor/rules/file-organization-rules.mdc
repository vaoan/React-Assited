description: Feature-first structure with co-location, stable module boundaries, and consistent naming.
globs: src/**/*
alwaysApply: true

- Group files by feature/domain
- Keep related files close together
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Organize imports with external libs first
- Split component logic across multiple simple functions

- **Module boundaries**

  - `domain` must not import from `infrastructure` or `presentation`.
  - `presentation` imports from `application` adapters, not raw GraphQL.

- **Co-location**

  - Keep tests next to source (`*.test.ts(x)`) when possible.
  - Keep mocks/fixtures inside the feature (`mocks/`) for discoverability.

- **Aliases**

  - Prefer `@/` path aliases to avoid brittle relative paths.
