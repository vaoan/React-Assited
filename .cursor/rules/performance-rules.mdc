- Memoize expensive computations
- Implement proper code splitting
- Optimize renders with React.memo
- Use virtualization for long lists
- Use React's React.lazy() and Suspense to load components only when needed
- Prefer `useRef` over `useState` when tracking non-rendering data
- Implement debouncing for search inputs and API requests like Google's autocomplete

- **Virtualization**

  - Use `@tanstack/react-virtual` or MUI DataGrid for large tables.

- **Apollo cache**

  - Tune type policies; avoid storing giant responses; normalize where possible.

- **Images/assets**
  - Prefer lazy loading.
